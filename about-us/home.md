blogtitle: MEU Sofia
strongblog: "Since it was first organized in 2014, the project Model European Union Sofia has become an accessible informal education platform about the European Union in Bulgaria. With each edition that followed, MEU Sofia expanded incredibly, reaching an ever growing number of young people from across Europe.

The editions in 2017 and 2018 were extremely successful, which is reflected both in the very positive feedback and the staggering 498 applications. Following long talks, participating in inspiring simulations around Europe and meeting many people supporting the idea for MEU Sofia 2021, after a short break, the project made a comeback in 2020! Thatâ€™s when work on the next edition, MEU Sofia 2021, started.

We are extremely grateful and happy to have a vibrant international team of more than 20 young individuals supporting MEU Sofia and working towards a more democratic and informed European society of tomorrow. Together, our team speaks more than 20 different languages and represents 10 nationalities which makes every single one of our meetings a true intercultural experience!
