MEU Sofia 2021 has different stages, with one of them being the simulation of the European Citizens’ Initiative, in which young Bulgarian high-school students will be involved. The project will find its conclusion in either a physical - or virtual, depending on the COVID-19 situation - simulation of the European Union legislative process in which the outcome of the work with the high-schoolers will be incorporated."
