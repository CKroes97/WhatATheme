Model European Union Sofia 2021 (MEU Sofia 2021) is an educational simulation of the legislative process of the European Union (EU). The project aims at three main goals – strengthening European values and democracy, being a platform for international youth exchange and informal education and promoting Bulgaria and the region to achieve better intercultural understanding within the European Union. The project started in December 2020 and is planned to end in December 2021. Model European Union Sofia 2021 has three main stages, through which the above mentioned goals will be pursued. The first stage consists in the work and socialization activities of the international Organising Team of MEU Sofia 2021. The second stage of the project will be an unprecedented simulation of the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI), in which young Bulgarian high school students will play a decisive role. The third and final stage will be a physical - virtual if necessary - simulation of the European Union legislative procedure, in which the outcome of the work with the high schoolers will be incorporated.
